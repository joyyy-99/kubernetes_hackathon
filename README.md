# 📦 Widgetario — Distributed Systems on Kubernetes

Widgetario is a gadget-selling company aiming to deploy its public-facing web application on Kubernetes. This project demonstrates how to configure, deploy, scale, and monitor microservices using Kubernetes with CI/CD and production-ready configurations.

---

## 📦 Project Overview

Widgetario is a fictional company that sells gadgets. The app is built with a microservices architecture and is deployed on Kubernetes. This repo showcases the full lifecycle from local development to production-grade deployment using industry-standard tools and patterns.

---

## 🛠️ Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed:

- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)
- [`kubectl`](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/)
- [Minikube](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/) or a Kubernetes cluster
- [Helm](https://helm.sh/)
- [Jenkins](https://www.jenkins.io/) (for CI/CD)
- Optional: [Testkube](https://testkube.io/) for testing pipelines

## 🔨 Hackathon Stages

| Part | Name | Description |
|------|------|-------------|
| **1** | Welcome to Widgetario | Containerize a basic application, deploy it via `kubectl`, and expose it using a Service. |
| **2** | Configuration | Use ConfigMaps and Secrets to manage app settings and separate config from code. |
| **3** | Storage | Use `PersistentVolume` and `PersistentVolumeClaim` for attaching storage to pods. |
| **4** | Ingress | Set up an Ingress controller (e.g., NGINX), route multiple services, and enable TLS. |
| **5** | Productionizing | Add probes, set resource limits, and implement security contexts. |
| **6** | Observability | Integrate Prometheus and Grafana for metrics, and Fluent Bit for logging. |
| **7** | CI/CD | Use Jenkins pipelines to automate builds, tests, and deployments triggered by GitHub Webhooks. |

Each stage has its own directory (`part1`, `part2`, ... `part7`) containing relevant code, manifests, and documentation.

## 🚀 Deployment Instructions

## Part 1 - Welcome to Widgetario
Widgetario wants to host its public web application on Kubernetes. Below is an architectural overview of the services and their interactions.

---

## Part 2 - Configuration
The project is set up with configurable deployments, services, and environment variables defined via Kubernetes manifests.

## Part 3 - Storage
Persistent storage is implemented using PersistentVolume and PersistentVolumeClaim resources. This ensures that data is retained even if pods are deleted or rescheduled.

## Part 4 - Ingress
To expose the services, ingress rules are defined using custom domain mappings.
- `widgetario.local` routes to the main web interface

- `api.widgetario.local/products` routes to the API

## Part 5 - Productionizing
The application is hardened for production by introducing:
- **Liveness and Readiness Probes**
- **Resource limits and requests**
- **Environment variable handling**
- **Error resilience and graceful degradation strategies**

---

## Part 6 - Observability
Observability is achieved using a combination of **Elastic** and **Grafana** dashboards, providing real-time insights into system performance and health.

## Part 7 - CI/CD
CI/CD pipelines are set up to automate the build, test, and deployment processes using GitHub Actions.
