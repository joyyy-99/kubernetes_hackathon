## Part 3 - Storage
Persistent storage is implemented using PersistentVolume and PersistentVolumeClaim resources. This ensures that data is retained even if pods are deleted or rescheduled.

## Part 5 - Productionizing
The application is hardened for production by introducing:
- **Liveness and Readiness Probes**
- **Resource limits and requests**
- **Environment variable handling**
- **Error resilience and graceful degradation strategies**

---

## Part 6 - Observability
Observability is achieved using a combination of **Elastic** and **Grafana** dashboards, providing real-time insights into system performance and health.
